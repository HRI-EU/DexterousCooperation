/*! \brief Joint gui class. Runs a JointWidget in its own thread, reads in
 *         the slider values, filters them, and provides them as command
 *         vector in a MatNd. Further, the gui displays the current joint
 *         angles communicated through the ComputeKinematics event.
 *

 *
 *         The class subscribes to the following events:
 *         - Start: Launches a JointWidget. This subscriber does not check if
 *                  another widget is already running.
 *         - Stop: Destroys all running JointWidgets
 *         - InitFromState: Sets the slider values of all running JointWidgets
 *                          to the values of the passed graph.
 *         - ComputeKinematics: Iterates all joint value filters and updates
 *                              the corresponding values.
 *         - EmergencyStop: Initializes all guis with the latest current state.
 *         - EmergencyRecover: Initializes all guis with the latest current
 *                             state.
